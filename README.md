# Programming-projects

Hi! In this repository I have stored a portion of projects I worked on throughout my time in university (the ones i could save from my other computer), in the Associate Degree of Software Development. 
It is divided in four files, which are the three main programming classes: Computer Programming 1 & 2 (C++), Data Structures (C++), and DataBase Systems (SQL).
Each file has subfiles for each project, while computer programming 1 & 2 also includes a file for the accompanying lab.
